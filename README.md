Package ‘**photobiologySun**’ complements other packages in the [*R for
photobiology* suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). It contains
spectral data for daylight, including sunlight and shade light. Package
‘photobiologySun’ also includes spectra measured or simulated for
different times of the day, and reference spectra for solar radiation.

This package contains only data. Data are stored as collections of
spectra of class `source_mspct` from package ‘photobiology’, which is
the core of the [*R for photobiology*
suite](https://www.r4photobiology.info/). Spectra can be easily plotted
with functions and methods from package
[‘ggspectra’](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggspectra/). The spectra
can be used seamlessly with functions from package
[‘photobioloy’](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiology/).
However, class `source_mspct` is derived from `list` and class
`source_spct` is derived from `data.frame` making the data also usable
as is with base R functions.

## Examples

``` r
library(ggspectra)
library(photobiologySun)
```

How many spectra are contained in the collection of spectra `gap.mspct`?
In this case the spectra are from a fast time series of measurements.

``` r
length(gap.mspct)
#> [1] 72
```

What are their names?

``` r
names(gap.mspct)
#>  [1] "spct.01" "spct.02" "spct.03" "spct.04" "spct.05" "spct.06" "spct.07"
#>  [8] "spct.08" "spct.09" "spct.10" "spct.11" "spct.12" "spct.13" "spct.14"
#> [15] "spct.15" "spct.16" "spct.17" "spct.18" "spct.19" "spct.20" "spct.21"
#> [22] "spct.22" "spct.23" "spct.24" "spct.25" "spct.26" "spct.27" "spct.28"
#> [29] "spct.29" "spct.30" "spct.31" "spct.32" "spct.33" "spct.34" "spct.35"
#> [36] "spct.36" "spct.37" "spct.38" "spct.39" "spct.40" "spct.41" "spct.42"
#> [43] "spct.43" "spct.44" "spct.45" "spct.46" "spct.47" "spct.48" "spct.49"
#> [50] "spct.50" "spct.51" "spct.52" "spct.53" "spct.54" "spct.55" "spct.56"
#> [57] "spct.57" "spct.58" "spct.59" "spct.60" "spct.61" "spct.62" "spct.63"
#> [64] "spct.64" "spct.65" "spct.66" "spct.67" "spct.68" "spct.69" "spct.70"
#> [71] "spct.71" "spct.72"
```

How many spectra are contained in the collection of spectra
`sun_reference.mspct`?

``` r
length(sun_reference.mspct)
#> [1] 5
```

What are their names? (The three “AM0” spectra are for the
extraterrestrial solar spectrum, AM0 = zero atmosphera. ASTM G173
corresponds to AM1.5 and frequently used in engineering.)

``` r
names(sun_reference.mspct)
#> [1] "ASTM.E490.AM0"    "ASTM.G173.direct" "ASTM.G173.global" "Gueymard.AM0"    
#> [5] "WMO.Wehrli.AM0"
```

Summary calculations can be easily done with methods from package
‘photobiology’. Here we calculate photon irradiance with function
`q_irrad()` for another collection of spectra. As the spectra are
normalised we pass `allow.scaled = TRUE`,

``` r
q_irrad(sun_hourly_august.spct, scale.factor = 1e6) # Q_Total: umol m-2 s-1
#> # A tibble: 31 × 3
#>    Q_Total spct.idx when.measured      
#>      <dbl> <chr>    <dttm>             
#>  1    98.9 spct.01  2014-08-21 03:30:00
#>  2   169.  spct.02  2014-08-21 04:30:00
#>  3   564.  spct.03  2014-08-21 05:30:00
#>  4   780.  spct.04  2014-08-21 06:30:00
#>  5   534.  spct.05  2014-08-21 07:30:00
#>  6  1255.  spct.06  2014-08-21 08:30:00
#>  7  1889.  spct.07  2014-08-21 09:30:00
#>  8  1914.  spct.08  2014-08-21 10:30:00
#>  9  1482.  spct.09  2014-08-21 11:30:00
#> 10  1264.  spct.10  2014-08-21 12:30:00
#> # ℹ 21 more rows
```

The `autoplot()` methods from package ‘ggspectra’ can be used for
plotting one or more spectra at a time.

``` r
autoplot(gap.mspct[1:10], annotations = c("-", "peaks")) + 
  theme_bw()
```

The classes of the objects used to store the spectral data are derived
from `"data.frame"` making direct use of the data with functions and
methods from base R and various packages easy.

## Documentation

HTML documentation is available at
(<https://docs.r4photobiology.info/photobiologySun/>), including a *User
Guide*.

News on updates to the different packages of the ‘r4photobiology’ suite
are regularly posted at (<https://www.r4photobiology.info/>).

Two articles introduce the basic ideas behind the design of the suite
and its use: Aphalo P. J. (2015)
(<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2015.1.14>) and Aphalo P. J. (2016)
(<https://doi.org/10.19232/uv4pb.2016.1.15>).

A book is under preparation, and the draft is currently available at
(<https://leanpub.com/r4photobiology/>).

A handbook written before the suite was developed contains useful
information on the quantification and manipulation of ultraviolet and
visible radiation: Aphalo, P. J., Albert, A., Björn, L. O., McLeod, A.
R., Robson, T. M., & Rosenqvist, E. (Eds.) (2012) Beyond the Visible: A
handbook of best practice in plant UV photobiology (1st ed., p. xxx +
